description: This website was built in collaboration with VCU Assistant Professor of English, Mary Caton Lingold, as a platform for her students, as well as students at other higher education institutions, to collect and  study sound artifacts to better understand our changing culture. The site is build in Drupal and integrates the InCommon federated single-signon identity management service. Sonic Dictionary was originally built using Omeka. Ruby was used to export content from the Omeka API (<a href="https://github.com/bnorberg/omeka_export">code</a>) in a data structure that could be ingested by the Drupal Feeds module.
