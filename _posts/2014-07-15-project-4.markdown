description: The Circle Student Newspaper Archive contains all editions of the Marsit College student newspaper. Each edition can be viewed online, searched, or downloaded using the Universal Viewer, an open source project that implements the IIIF protocol. The historical data for the project came from contracting out the scanning of saved paper versions. Current versions of the Marist Circle, which is now an online-first publication, are harvested using a Python script.
