description: Visualization dashboard of activity completed during the Mellon Foundation grant, Humanities Writ Large, at Duke University. The data for the dashboard came from an export from the <a href="https://humanitieswritlarge.duke.edu/">HWL</a> site that was converted to the necessary csv structure for the visualization with Ruby. The dashboard was used to show the impact of the grant and to identify fruitful partnerships and structure that could be explored in the next grant.
